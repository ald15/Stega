# Stega
<b> Steganography </b>
<p><b>[The project is under development]</b></p>
<p>
An attempt to write a program using the steganography method to hide information 
(a text message)inside an image (to begin with, in the format .bmp) due to the redundancy
of information (a slight change in the color of the pixel the human eye is not able to catch), 
as well as the ability to decrypt the message from the image.
